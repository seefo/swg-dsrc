# FIX
#
# The fix for Wookiee wearables: skin-shader-related customization variables 
# must be named /shared_owner/ for the stitched-in skin to have access to
# the customization variables.  Artists adjusted the following assets but
# we need to still fake that these assets have a /private/index_texture_1
# so that the data from the database gets loaded into this 'erroneous' variable.
# If we didn't do this, we wouldn't be able to preserve the Wookiee settings
# for existing Wookiee players who log in after the fix to the art assets
# is applied.
